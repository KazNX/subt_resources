The [DARPA Subterranean (SubT) Challenge](https://subtchallenge.com/) program sparked innovation in mapping, navigation, and search of underground environments.
This documentation provides links to some of the resources developed and shared by DARPA and SubT Challenge competitors, organized by these 5 technology areas:

* [Mobility](1-Mobility.md)
* [Autonomy](2-Autonomy.md)
* [Perception](3-Perception.md)
* [Networking](4-Networking.md)
* [Simulation](5-Simulation.md)

Resources include _open-source software_, _hardware_, and _datasets_ created or expanded in support of the SubT Challenge.

These are optionally submitted by competitors and although this is not an all-inclusive list, we hope these resources may be utilized and further expanded by the broader robotics community.

Teams who competed in any of the SubT Challenge events for the Systems and/or Virtual Competitions are welcome to contribute links to resources they have developed. Please see the [contribution guide](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.
